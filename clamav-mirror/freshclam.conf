DatabaseOwner clam

# database.clamav.net is now the primary domain name to be used world-wide.
# Now that CloudFlare is being used as our Content Delivery Network (CDN),
# this one domain name works world-wide to direct freshclam to the closest
# geographic endpoint.
# If the old db.XY.clamav.net domains are set, freshclam will automatically
# use database.clamav.net instead.
